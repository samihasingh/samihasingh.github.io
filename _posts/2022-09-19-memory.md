As a computer science enthusiast, I am always looking for ways to put my skills to the test and create projects that can benefit others. Recently, I embarked on a project that combined my passion for computer science with my love for social events - a memory game based on Simon.

The idea behind the project was simple: to create a computerized version of the classic memory game that could be used as an icebreaker in social events. I wanted to create a game that would not only help people improve their memory skills but also provide a fun and interactive way for people to connect with each other.

To bring this project to life, I used Java data structures to architect and implement the game. I designed the game to be easy to use, even for those who are not familiar with programming. The game would display a sequence of colors and sounds, and the player would have to repeat the sequence back in the correct order. With each round, the sequence would get longer, making the game more challenging.

To make the game more engaging, I designed a UI interface that displayed various elements, such as characters, menu, current round number, and unique positive affirmations. The positive affirmations would appear after each round to motivate the player and keep them engaged. The interface was user-friendly and easy to navigate, making the game accessible to anyone.

After completing the project, I tested it with a group of friends, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. People loved the game, and it helped them connect with each other in a fun and interactive way. As a result, the game was used in multiple social events, and more than 15 people played it.

In conclusion, creating a memory game based on Simon was an exciting project that allowed me to combine my passion for computer science with my love for social events. It was a great way to challenge myself and create something that can benefit others. I hope to continue creating projects like this in the future and help bring people together through technology.
