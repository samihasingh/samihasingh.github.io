# Welcome

### My Journey

Growing up in a multicultural environment, I was exposed to diverse perspectives and innovative ideas from a young age. This unique background has fueled my passion for technology and entrepreneurship, leading me to pursue a dual degree in Computer Science and Business at UC Berkeley.

### My Focus

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have been committed to leveraging technology and business strategies to drive social impact. My experiences range from consulting and product management to leading diversity initiatives and founding educational platforms. Here are a few highlights:

* **Business Strategy**: As a Business Analyst Intern at McKinsey & Company and an Economic Policy Consulting Intern at Ernst & Young LLP, I developed strategic insights and provided data-driven recommendations that impacted high-level decision-making processes.
* **Leadership in Diversity and Inclusion**: At 180 Degrees Consulting, I held various roles, including Director of DEI and Internal Vice President, where I spearheaded initiatives to promote diversity and inclusivity within organizations.
* **Entrepreneurship and Social Impact**: As the founder of Operation Education, I created educational resources that reached over 10,000 students, and at Free Ventures, I expanded mentorship programs to support underrepresented startup founders.
